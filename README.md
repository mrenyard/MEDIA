# MEDIA.
Currently a holding project for `assets/media` directory for RAMP projects.
## Getting started with MEDIA (independently of RAMP).
> **NOTE:** If you are using [RAMP](https://github.com/mrenyard/RAMP) to drive your website/application along with [`Web-Project-Managment-Tools`](https://github.com/mrenyard/Web-Project-Managment-Tools) as recommended by default then you will NOT need to read beyond this point.

To use MEDIA simply place the contents of this GitHub repository within a `media` folder below the root of your web directory, most commonly within an `assets` folder.
```

  +-- public_html       (website root folder)
  |  |-- index.html      (static homepage)?
  |  +-- controller.php  (RAMP controller file)
  |  +-- assets
  |     +-- media        <-- HELLO from MEDIA.
  |     |  +-- img
  |     |  +-- video
  |     |  +-- README.md
  |     +-- func
